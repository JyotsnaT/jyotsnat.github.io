Hello! Welcome to my world! 

*If you want to check out my professional journey and are interested in working with me check out the 'resume' tab. If you are seeking some infomation on my technical write-ups check out the 'Tech' drop-down. The non-technical section can be found on 'Life' tab.* 


:chestnut: :shell: In a nutshell 
    
:robot: I am an ML professional with experience in applied ML across big tech and mid size companies. Building AI products excites me and I am good at it. Being from India, I had to take my education seriously and hence completed my masters from IITM. 

:blossom: I grew up in the Himalayas amidst rich Indian music culture and enjoy dancing to bollywood numbers (like a lot!!). Being from a spiritual background, I find solace in practicing yoga and meditation whenever I can.

:cookie: I am moderately opinionated and enjoy lowest of humours like 'puns'. My vedic astro sun sign is 'Scorpion' and I am also an ENFJ.
