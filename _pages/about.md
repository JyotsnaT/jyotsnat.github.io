ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm an ML professional with six years of experience working in both big tech and mid-sized companies. I specialize in building AI products, and Iâ€™m passionate about the impact they can make. I hold a master's degree from IIT Madras, where I developed a strong academic foundation in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

ðŸŒ„ I grew up in the Himalayas, surrounded by the vibrant Indian music culture, and I absolutely love dancing to Bollywood tunes. My spiritual background has instilled in me a deep appreciation for yoga and meditation, which I practice regularly to find balance and peace.

ðŸŽ­ Outside of work, I'm moderately opinionated and have a soft spot for puns and low-key humor. As a Scorpion in Vedic astrology and an ENFJ personality type, I bring a blend of passion and empathy to everything I do.

Welcome, and I hope you enjoy exploring my world!
